Algorithms Used:
Huffman Coding:

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression technique that assigns variable-length codes to characters
based on their frequency of occurrence in the input file. The most frequently occurring characters are
assigned the shortest codes, while the least frequently occurring characters are assigned longer codes. The
compressed file is generated by replacing the characters in the input file with their respective codes.
The steps involved in implementing Huffman coding are as follows:
 Frequency table generation: A frequency table is generated by scanning the input file and counting the
frequency of occurrence of each character in the file.
 Construction of Huffman tree: A binary tree is constructed using the frequency table generated in step
1. The two characters with the lowest frequencies are combined to form a new node, which is then inserted
into the tree with a frequency equal to the sum of the frequencies of the two characters. This process is
repeated until all the characters are included in the tree.
 Generation of Huffman codes: Huffman codes are generated by traversing the Huffman tree from the
root node to each leaf node. A &#39;0&#39; is appended to the code if the left child of the node is visited, and a &#39;1&#39; is
appended if the right child of the node is visited.
 Encoding of the input file: The input file is encoded using the Huffman codes generated in step 3. Each
character in the input file is replaced by its corresponding Huffman code.
 Writing the compressed file: The compressed file is generated by writing the frequency table and the
encoded input file to a new file.
 Decompression of the compressed file involves the reverse process of Huffman coding. The frequency
table is extracted from the compressed file, and the Huffman tree is reconstructed. The encoded input file is
then decoded using the Huffman tree to generate the original input file.

Caesar Cipher:
Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption algorithm that involves shifting each character in the input file by a
fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, if the shift value is 3, then the letter &#39;A&#39; is replaced
by &#39;D&#39;, &#39;B&#39; by &#39;E&#39;, and so on. The shift value is also known as the key for encryption.
The steps involved in implementing Caesar Cipher are as follows:
 Reading the compressed file: The compressed file generated by Huffman coding is read into the
program.

 Decryption using Caesar Cipher: The compressed file is decrypted using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
Each character in the compressed file is shifted back by the same number of positions in the alphabet as the
key used for encryption.
 Writing the decompressed file: The decompressed file is generated by writing the decrypted data to a
new file.
